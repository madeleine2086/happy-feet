                    <br>
                    <h3>Place where you'll find everything you need to know about feet</h3>

                <h3>Why should you look after your feet?</h3>
                <p>When it comes down to footcare it's important to first understand the anatomy of our feet.
                    We are not going to overwhelm you with specific information, as the percentage of medicine and podiatry students among
                    people visiting this site is probably low, but it's good to know that each foot consists of 26 bones connected
                    by joints, muscles, tendons and ligaments. Issues with that complex structure can cause knee, back and hip pain,
                    imbalance, poor posture and even organ dysfunction.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
                <h3>Why it is important to react as soon as the first signs of a problem appear?</h3>
                <p>As mentioned above, ongoing foot problems can lead to quite serious medical conditions. Therefore acting quickly
                    will prevent more damage being caused to the feet and minimize pain. We encourage you to scroll through this page and find out when you should see a specialist.</p>

                <h3>Where can you get help?</h3>
                <p>It's always a good idea to see a podiatrist or your GP (if you don't have access to podiatrist). You can also
                    go to our 'Get Help' section and
                    ask us any question! We'll be back in touch within 48 hours. Feel free to connect with us on our social
                    media (links can be found on the bottom of this page), as we are posting a lot of information about
                    footcare and feet issues regularly.</p>
