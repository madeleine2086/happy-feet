        <h2>How to properly care for your feet...</h2>
        <p>Caring for feet is not only making sure they're clean. It is also making sure that skin
            is moisturised and appropriate shoes are worn.
            Please take a look at the three main areas everyone should focus on:
        </p>
        <section id="care-section">
            <div>
                <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-soap"></i></i> Hygiene</h3>
                <p>
                    The most basic of the basic - hygiene. Yes, yes... we do know that everyone knows that, but are you doing it properly?
                    Are you actually washing your feet with soap or do you let water just rinse them while in the shower? Do you dry them quickly
                     or take your time making sure spaces in between your toes are dry too? You (all of us really) should be doing the latter.

                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-droplet"></i> Moisture</h3>
                <p>Even though you've only got out of the shower, moisturising your feet (when they're dry!!) is a must. The skin on your feet
                    is like the skin on your face and body - it needs some love. Make sure you have a good foot cream, moisturise every day and 
                    never between your toes.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-shoe-prints"></i> Footwear</h3>
                <p>Pretty shoes are not always the ones you should wear. Same goes for the price, it does not determine how good your 
                    shoes are. Remember that the shoe size is only a guide, try them on (with socks on) and walk around before purchase. Always buy shoes 
                    at the end of the day when your feet are larger. This way you can be sure they won't be too tight. If you can't wiggle your 
                    toes - it's not your size.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>
